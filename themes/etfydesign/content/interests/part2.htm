<p class="pt-0">By developing news skills and connecting with the technology side of those projects, I felt a strong call for programming.
      In 2020, when we were pushed into lockdown, I realised there were less challenges in the job I was occupying, and this 
      is the reason I decided to study coding at TÃ©luq.  For me, programming is a new universe that offers new opportunities 
      for me to learn, to grow in a world of change and of infinite possibilities and, mostly, brand new challenges to tackle.  
      I love creating, using my imagination to find unusual solutions ("out of the box") and when I have free time, I am always 
      working on a software project (for example, improving this portfolio website, working on a video game project, etc.) or
      on a new costume project.  I also have a strong interest in Psychology, including Cognitive Psychology and Learning in 
      general: this is what made me decide to obtain my first university degree a couple of years ago.</p>
