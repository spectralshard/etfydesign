<p>I always had a great passion for videogames, which inspired me to create costumes of characters I used to play with. In
 my early life, I studied fashion design with the objective to master the construction of patterns and garments. I've been a 
 pattern maker / fit and spec technician for over 15 years and I even started my own costume making company.  Since the industry 
 is very limited, I was always trying to push the limits of my knowledge with new projects, and this is why, for many years, I 
 have committed myself to participate in costume competitions across the country, always pushing my limits further in the 
 conception and engineering of costumes.  Often, I was looking for ways to include electronic devices (e.g. Arduino boards), 
 LEDs and motors into my costumes and to create 3D printed accessories.  </p>
